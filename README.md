chatsy-alpha
============

A simple chat application for all users. It is still a Work in Progress, so contributors and collabarators are welcome.

BLUEPRINT:

Options available: anonymous, private and public featuring groups.

Users joining Anonymous groups will be, well, anonymous. Absolutely no tracking (well except your alias - this is to prevent spammers). Anonymous groups can be private or public.

Private groups are secure and need a key to enter. 

Public groups are open to all and based on the group creator (might have no passkey or have a public key).

A created group can be embedded in any website (by the group owner or admin) [MAIN TARGET]

There are still some ideas to incorporate and they will be added soon...

TECHNOLOGIES: 

Server: node + hapijs
Frontend: semantic-ui, handlebars (TODO angular, meteor or ember)
